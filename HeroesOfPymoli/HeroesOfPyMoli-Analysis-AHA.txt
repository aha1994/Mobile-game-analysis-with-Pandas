Overall there are 780 transactions recorded in this dataset. There are only 576 unqiue players, indicating that the majority of players who have
made a purchase, only made a single purchase. The vast of the playerbase who made a purchase is male. However, the average purchase price and average
total amount spent were higher for the female and other/undisclosed groups. This indicates that they are either willing to spend more, or the items that
appeal to them cost more to begin with. 76.74% of the player base falls into the age 15-29 range, with the most players falling between the ages of
20 and 24. It makes sense that this age group had the most purchases count. The item "Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm" was 
not only the most sold by count, it was also the most profitbale.
